# Systems Engineering: Smart House Lock System

## Problem Identification 
One of the common problems in day-to-day life is misplacing the house keys. We spend an inordinate amount of time searching for them and waiting for someone else to help us get in the house. The security is compromised the moment a key is lost and requires the whole lock to be replaced. There is also a dependency that the traditional mechanical/deadbolt lock creates on the owner to be present at home to unlock the door for guests or family members. 
At times, even after locking the door, we often are unsure if we locked and want a better way to validate that than having to go back physically to check the door lock. There is no security surveillance system present in the traditional lock system which could provide information about the possible attempts to unlock the door.

## Our Solution 
We aim to solve the problem by taking a smart approach to security. We are engineering a battery operated electromechanical Smart House Lock System, which can perform locking and unlocking operations when it receives such instructions from authorized user(s).

## Important Features 

* **Security - Fingerprint technology and remote access capabilities**
The door can be locked/unlocked with a simple tap on the lock, which reads the fingerprint and grants access. It can also be operated using digital remote keys shared by the owner, iOS and Android mobile application, web application, and popular smart home devices like Google home, Amazon Alexa, and Apple Siri.

* **Portability - Designed to be installed on existing mechanical/deadbolt locks**
This eliminates the need to replace the existing system, while upgrading the door lock to operate with a physical key as well as with a smart key.

* **Connectivity - Mobile app capabilities**
The lock can be operated using the mobile app. The app also shows the status of the lock (locked/unlocked) and battery life.
It has a built-in Wi-Fi bridge that allows the lock to be controlled from anywhere as long as the lock is connected to the home router.

* **Extending access - Authorized user(s) & Special priveleges**
Customer should sign up as the owner and then assign special privileges to friends, family members, or maintenance staff, who will then be recognized as authorized users. Owner can either give full access or limit the access to certain days of the week or even certain times of the day.
